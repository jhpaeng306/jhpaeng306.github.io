## Research Internships
### Ryu Optimization Group
* Advisor: **Prof. Ernest K. Ryu**, Department of Mathematics, SNU

#### Asymptotic behavior of Randomized Coordinate FPI without any fixed point [1]
* Proved almost sure convergence of the normalized iterate using Robbins-Siegmund quasi-martingale theorem.
* Discovered the tight upper bound of limit supremum of the variance of normalized iterate.
* Developed an infeasibility detection for randomized FPI-type methods. 
* Extended the result to general M-norm, allowing applications to solvers such as the decentralized optimization method.

### HYKE Research Group
* Advisor: **Prof. Seung-Yeal Ha**, Department of Mathematics, SNU

#### Application of Renormalization Group Method on Lohe Sphere Model [2]
* Proved that Complete synchronized state among particles with identical natural frequencies forms a stable manifold of the Lohe Sphere model using RG method.
* Developed lemmas on the integration of matrix exponential by using Jordan form.
* 2021 Undergraduate’s Research Program (Research Fund of $6,000 per Team) by *SNU Faculty of Liberal Education*.

#### Estimation of Spectrum Density function using Maximum Entropy Rate
* Reviewed p-th order Markov process AR(p) and its spectrum density function.
* Using the notion of maximum entropy, Burg’s theorem and its application on the
method of estimation on the spectrum density function were covered.
* Spring 2021 Undergraduate’s Research Internship (Research Fund of $700) by *SNU CNS*.
