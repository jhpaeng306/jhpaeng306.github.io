## About me

![image](/assets/img/square.jpeg){: style="float: left; padding:15px"}{:width="33%"}

My name is **Jinhee Paeng**. I am an undergraduate student in Seoul National University (SNU). I am majoring in Mathematics, with Statistics as my double major. I am planning to graduate B.S. at June 2024, and start my PhD studies at Fall 2024. 
Here is my [Curriculum Vitae](/pdfs/CV.pdf).

Academically I am interested in neural networks and emergence of intelligence, and aim to develop mathematical theories about such topics. Thus I am naturally enthusiastic at related mathematical or near-mathematical fields such as convex optimization, machine learning, PDEs and dynamical systems, stochastic processes, and data analysis.

<br/>

### Research Interests
* Neural Networks, Convex Optimization, Deep Learning, Data Analysis, 
* PDE, Stochastic Process, Mathematical Biology

## Publication
#### Coordinate-Update Algorithms can Efficiently Detect Infeasible Optimization Problems
* Authors: **Jinhee Paeng**, Jisun Park, and Ernest K. Ryu
* Analysis on the asymptotic behavior of Randomized Coordinate FPI without any fixed points. Proved almost sure convergence of the normalized iterates to the negative infimal displacement vector and discovered asymptotic upper bound of the variance.
* Preprint, Under Review of JMAA, Available in [arXiv.2305.12211](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2305.12211)
* Here's a [25min Overview video](https://youtu.be/XR38uybRRuA) and [Slides](/pdfs/RC_FPI_slides.pdf) explaining this work. 

#### Applications of Renormalization group method for generalized Kuramoto type models
* Authors: **Jinhee Paeng**, Kibeom Myoung, Seungmok Lee, Seung Yeal Ha, and Jaeyoung Yoon
* Applied the Renormalization Group Method on Lohe Sphere Model to prove that the complete synchronization state among particles with the identical natural frequencies forms a stable state. 
* Preprint, [PDF](/pdfs/RGmethod.pdf), [Poster](/pdfs/RGmethod_poster.pdf)
